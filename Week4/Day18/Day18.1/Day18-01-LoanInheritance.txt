Case Study: Loan EMI Calculation System
A bank is building an EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) calculation module for different loan products.
All loans share common data, but EMI calculation rules differ by loan type. Due to legacy constraints, the system must not use polymorphism (virtual/override).

Functional Requirements
1. Base Class: Loan

Create a base class named Loan.
Properties
LoanNumber (string)
CustomerName (string)
PrincipalAmount (decimal)
TenureInYears (int)
Constructor

Initialize all properties using a parameterized constructor.

create CalculateEMI method.
to return 10% interest simple.

Derived Class: HomeLoan
Inherit from Loan.
Business Rules
Flat interest rate: 8%
One-time processing fee: 1% of PrincipalAmount

Derived Class: CarLoan
Inherit from Loan.
Business Rules
Flat interest rate: 9%
Insurance charge: ₹15,000 (added to principal)

Can we create a member again in derived class 
with same name? Yes
Warning -  Hiding base class member

Create 2 Home Loan objects
Create 2 Car Loan Objects
Add all in an array.
call CalculateEMI on all objects using loop

In this try to understand,
each object is calling base class method.
